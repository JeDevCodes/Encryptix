          <strong> 'Cricket is a religion in India and Sachin is God'.</strong>
          ☛ Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar was born on 24 April 1973. His father's name
          is Ramesh Tendulkar, who was a Marathi novelist who wrote many Marathi
          novels. His mother's name is Rajni Tendulkar. Sachin is a former
          Indian cricket player who was also the captain of the Indian national
          team in many events.<br /><br />
          ☛ He is considered to be the greatest batsman in the history of Indian
          Cricket after Sir Donald George Bradman and Sir Vivian Richards.<br /><br />
          ☛For a few people, he is a god and for others, he is the epitome of
          success on which the future of Indian cricket is the judge. Throughout
          his career of 30 years, he has accomplished wonders for the Indian
          cricket team and that is why many people worship him as the God of
          cricket. <br /><br />
          ☛ On 15 November 1989, Sachin Tendulkar made his international debut
          against Pakistan in Karachi. Pakistans's cricket team was known for
          its bowling during those days where the combo of Wasim Akram and Waqar
          Younis were considered to be the most dangerous bowling duo. But
          Sachin faced them gracefully and even made a few runs. <br /><br />
          ☛During the years 1994-1999, Sachin Tendulkar was in his twenties and
          his performance was at its peak. He opened the batting against New
          Zealand in 1994 and made 84 runs from just 49 balls, He then went on
          and scored his first ODI century against Australia. It took him around
          78 ODI's to score his first century but it was worth the wait.
          <br /><br />
          ☛ The main contribution of Sachin Tendulkar was the way he changed the
          opening of cricket. The Indian team was struggling with opening
          batsmen as many of them were unable to give India a good start against
          any teams. The whole scenario changed when Sachin was allowed to open
          the innings against New Zealand in 1992 and he made it count. After
          that match, he was the opening batsman for the Indian cricket team.
          <br /><br />
          ☛ Before getting recognized by the world for his talent, Sachin
          Tendulkar played a school cricket tournament match where he had a 664
          runs partnership with Vinod Kambli. Sachin was only 16 years old when
          he played that match and is considered to be the turning point in
          Sachin Tendulkar's life. <br /><br />
          ☛ On 10 October 2013, Sachin Tendulkar announced his retirement from
          all forms of cricket after a two-test match against the West Indies in
          November. The BCCI had arranged two farewell matches to be played at
          Kolkata and Mumbai. He scored 74 runs in his last test innings against
          West Indies and fell short of 79 runs to complete 16,000 runs in test
          cricket. The cricket association of Mumbai and Bengal had organised
          events to mark his retirement from the sport. Various politicians and
          international celebrities were present to witness the last inning of
          the master blaster. <br /><br />
